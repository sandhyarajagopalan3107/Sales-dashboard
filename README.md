**Flipkart Sales Analysis Report**
Sales performance is a critical metric for any business, as it directly impacts revenue, growth, and customer satisfaction. Weekly sales reports help track trends, identify opportunities, and address challenges.
For this project:
  -> Dataset: Monthly sales transactions across multiple regions and product categories.
  -> Objective: Clean, preprocess, and transform raw data using Excel, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
  -> Dashboard: Created in Power BI to visualize KPIs, trends, and customer behaviour in a professional, interactive format.
	-> Real-world relevance: Simulates how retail chains or e-commerce platforms monitor sales performance and make strategic decisions.
What I Have:
	-> Raw Data: Original sales dataset containing order dates, product categories, sales amounts, and other relevant fields.
	-> Cleaned Data: Processed and cleaned version of the sales data in Excel, including removal of duplicates, arranging dates properly, and eliminating unnecessary      data.
	-> Pivot Tables and Charts in Excel: Created pivot tables to summarize the three key performance indicators (KPIs):
	     Total Sales
	     Sales by Category
       Monthly Sales Trends
       Charts were developed based on these pivot tables to visualize trends and category performance.
  -> Power BI Dashboard: An interactive dashboard was created in Power BI using the cleaned data to visualize the KPIs dynamically. The dashboard includes slicers       and filters for detailed data exploration.
